> Learning the fundamentals of JAVA

### Java compilation

**Byte Code** > **Java Virtual Machine** > **Native Code**

### Java Editions

1. Standard Edition
2. Enterprise Edition
3. Micro Edition 
4. Java Card

## Two types of data

1. Primitive Types
   - Numbers: Byte, short, int, long, float, double
   - Char
   - Boolean

2. Reference Types (Non-primitive)
   - Their values are usually their location in memory, that's why it's called "reference type"
   - Array
   - Object
   - String

### Method overloading

Method that are implemented multiple times

### Expression

Piece of code that produces a value

### Compound assignment operator
    - Augmented assignment operator
    - E.g: +=, -=, >= ... 

### Two types of Casting
    
     1. Implicit Casting
        - Automatic Conversion
        - E.g: byte > short > int > long > float > double

    2. Explicit Casting
        - Manual Conversion or Forced Conversion
        - E.g: (int) 1.1;

### Factory Method

Creates objects without specifying the exact class that will be instantiated.

### Packaging Java

jar = Java Archive

1. File > Project Structure > Artifacts > JAR > modules with dependencies.
2. Build > Build artifacts
3. open file in terminal
4. Run this command: 

```
java -jar NameOfJarFile.jar
```
